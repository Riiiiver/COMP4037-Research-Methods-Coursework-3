  abstract = {Cloud Computing is the latest paradigm that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet, based on a pay-as-you-go approach. It allows for provision of a variety of business and customer services. Consumers, especially the business organizations, can extend their existing computing provision and easily scale up Information Technology (IT) facilities by consuming services available in the Cloud. There are generally three varieties of services, namely, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and four types of deployment approaches, viz., Private Clouds, Public Clouds, Community Clouds and Hybrid Clouds. Enterprises, who have implemented appropriate Enterprise Architectures (EA), can scale up their `technical architectures' by integrating the existing infrastructure with the PaaS and IaaS provisions. Similarly, they can extend `information and application architectures' by utilizing the PaaS and SaaS offerings. Thus, Cloud Computing can provide a useful extension to existing EAs, on demand and without the additional capital investment. This chapter discusses the Cloud and EA concepts, principles, technologies, deployment approaches and associated frameworks. It provides a basic overview and sets the background for the rest of the chapters in this book.},

  abstractNote = {Cloud computing has swiftly established itself as the norm in its field as a result of the advantages described above. In an attempt to reduce the amount of time spent on infrastructure upkeep, an increasing number of businesses are moving their operations to the cloud. As a result, maintaining a cloud environment has proved to be exceedingly difficult. It is necessary to have an efficient cloud monitoring system in order to reduce the workload associated with administration and improve cloud operation. The cloud monitoring service is beneficial since it has the potential to improve performance and make administration easier. The administration of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters for cloud-hosted, virtualized, and physical services and applications is one of the most important responsibilities of cloud monitoring. As a result, cloud management software retains a record of both actions and services, and it also conducts dynamic setups of the cloud in order to increase operational effectiveness. The performance of businesses and businesses as a whole was examined in this article, as was the influence that cloud-ready programs and tools have on that performance, as well as the advantages that may be obtained from adopting such programs and products.},
